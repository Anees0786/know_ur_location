# IP Geolocation Script

This Python script uses the `geocoder` library to get the geolocation (latitude and longitude) of the public IP address of the system.

## Usage

1. Install the `geocoder` library:

    ```bash
    pip install geocoder
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python geolocation.py
    ```

3. View the console output, which displays the latitude and longitude of the public IP address.

Note: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system and have internet connectivity to fetch the IP geolocation.
